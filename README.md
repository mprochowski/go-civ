# go-civ - golang console image viewer
## Why ?
Because I can :sunglasses: But seriously, I'm learning golang and I want to create something for fun and maybe someday I will see this project in the "Golang Weekly" newsletter in the "code & tools" section :nerd_face:

## Usage
```
go run . -image={IAMGE_PATH}
```
## Limitation
Currently, only supports PNG files.
